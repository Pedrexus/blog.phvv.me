The first line is the hardest one. Thus, write about it.

I had this idea of blogging and writing recently and I must say I have been losing a lot of time with configurations of it instead of writing per se. Yesterday, I read [here][medium writing $10000] that it would take me about 60 days to create a writing habit ✍🏻, so here I am starting it. I have no experience whatsoever in blogging, but trying couldn't hurt, could it? 🤷🏼‍♂️

First of all, I am not very good at writing and english is not my native language, so this might be tough to accomplish. Besides, this is supposed to be totally unplanned. The only plan is to get to my computer everyday and write a little bit. You don't need to tell me I could be doing this on Twitter, Medium or even facebook. It's just that I want this to be something more random and maybe even personal. There is something special about doing something everyone can see (it's on the internet for God's sake!), yet they don't (this site doesn't even show up on Google - yet).

Anyway, this is just random practice. I will probably turn this into some sort of "personal column" where I write thoughts, opinions, routines and ideas. And if you're reading this, I hope you'll like it.

You all remember well when I said I would try to write every single day for 60 days, right? I bring some news: it's hard. However, it was not an useless absence as I was still writing, just not for the blog but for a post about python debugging in vscode that I've planned.

My original idea was very simple: I would take 4-5 hours a day to write this post and finish it within a week. You might think the problem was that I wasn't committed enough and didn't took the 4-5 hours. Wrong! I took them, but the real problem was that it was not enough. 

Before starting to write I build up this plan on all the subjects I'd like to cover on my post and it seemed a little too much, but as I later found out it was actually **over the top too much**! I took two weeks writing and couldn't even get to half of it ðŸ˜…. That's why I wish to write this so to understand my mistakes and evolve (or try to) as I further dedicate myself to the glorious art of writing (sarcasm ðŸ™ƒ).

1. Planning was excellent ðŸŸ¢
   - planning what I was going to write and the subjects I should cover was a very good idea. It allowed me to remember what would be the next step between writing pauses, and I was able to have a broader sense of the whole text.
2. But the plan has to be feasible ðŸ”´
   - Since I reserved a whole day to planning, I started to put all the minimally related things in the plan and I thought like: "this is going to be perfect" and it would, if I took another three weeks to write it.
   - planning too much is idealization.
3. Planning should be made in steps ðŸ”µ
   - I am already starting my next post, and I am very thrilled with it, but I decided to change adapt the way I plan: instead of planing the whole text, I realized a single post could be made of simpler _subposts_. Then, I divided the text in _themes_ I want to cover and plan only this one for now. That should help me get the sense of accomplishment that would maintain my motivation.
   - break the plan and then break it again
4. Planning should forsee my motivation ðŸ”µ
   - This sounds crazy, but I think it's possible. On the last couple of weeks I started adapting my routine around this _blog job_ to avoid a burnout. Recently, I read a medium post [link] about how having a blog is an endless task: I am the only one to set the limit. Otherwise, it'd be possible to spend several days in a row building a React component until I am _"satisfied"_. 

   - On my last post, I was excited on the first week, but kind of lost the thrill on the second week because it felt endless. That's why I believe that the plan for the next week should be done with this mindset: _"where can I get on monday if I dedicate 3 hours"_ instead of _"I need to dedicate 3 hours per day to get this post done by the end of the week"_. There is a big difference.
   - plan to yourself, not to the post.
5. Routine is the friend I need ðŸŸ¢
   - I don't like routine a lot, but I confess it helped me with the last post. Every weekday now I wake up, make my bed, have breakfast, brush my teeth and take a shower before going to the computer. I'd like to add exercises and meditation to this as well, but more about this on the future. After this simple morning routine, I feel like I can get more focus and get _in the zone_ easier. 

   - Besides, I try to deal with this blog just like a job: I focus myself on it from 9AM until 11AM and from 2PM until 5PM. Of course this is only possible if nothing else from my other arrangements show up, but it serves as the general outline. This really helps me stay motivated on the long run instead of that _I do it whenever I can_ mess of before. 
6. Weekends should be productive as well ðŸ”µ

   - I feel the weekends ruin my productivity though. Last weekend I forced myself to do nothing about the blog and I kept telling me that _"this was relaxing"_. However, this reminded me the quote from the [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) book. That's why I am trying to do something this next weekend, only with reduced working hours (probably try to work only in the morning when people are still sleeping).
   - structure the weekend and the pauses too.

I feel like I learned a lot with the previous experience. There are still other things to be considered and enhancements to be made, but I am content with how things are going for now. Soon this might start to get some traction.

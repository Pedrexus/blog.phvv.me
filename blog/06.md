I missed you too, my dear reader. 

I can already feel the online crowd embracing me on my online return. Unfortunately I haven't really found an excuse for my disappearance, but I found something definitely better: **a job!** 🕺

Yeah, I am working as a backend developer for [petco.com][petco.com] now. It's been great, thanks for asking. 

This is a short blog post just to say that I'm finally adapted to the new routine and I want to write in here more often.

It is good to be back 😎.
